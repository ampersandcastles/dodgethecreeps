# Dodge the Creeps
This is my take on the tutorial from the [Godot docs](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/getting_started/first_2d_game/index.html).

Nothing special, however this was a very fun experience. I definitely learned more doing this than I have trying to learn any other type of programming language or development.
